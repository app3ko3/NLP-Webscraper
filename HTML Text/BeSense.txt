Association Group2 
If there is any device under Association Group2, the door sensor will send ÒBASIC SETÓ 
command to control those devices when the door sensor is triggered. For example: when the door 
sensor is triggered, it sends adjustable parameter ÒBASIC SETÓ command to a lamp under 
Group2, you can adjust the lampÕs luminance through the parameters of this command; if the set 
light-up time out (see the ConÞguration Description), the sensor will send ÒBASIC 
SETÓcommand to turn-off the lamp. 
When sensor is triggered:

command to control that device when the door sensor is opened. ÒValueÓ conÞguration rule is as 
below:
 
b) Turn Off Light Time ConÞguration
!
If there is any device under Association Group2, the door sensor will send ÒBasic Set = valueÓ 
command to Group2, and send ÒBasic Set = 0x00Ó command to turn-off light after ÒtÓ seconds,

You should now see this device type in your list of Device Handlers 
How To assign a custom DEVICE HANDLER to my Z-Wave device 
Simply exclude the device if you had included it prior to installing the new device 
handler. Then add the device to your SmartThings hub by clicking on Add thing > + 
Connect New Device in your app. Press and release the tamper switch three times on 
the sensor quickly. 
Remember to keep the device within 3 feet away from your hub during inclusion Ñ the 
device should be automatically discovered as the BeSense Motion sensor. Then, leave 
the sensor by the hub for a few hours so it can fully configure. 
And that should be it! I hope this was helpful in simplifying the process behind custom 
device handlers. Feel free to contact us if you have any question.

Command Class Specification 
Lifeline Group 
When the door sensor is opened or recovered, it will send ÒBinary Sensor ReportÓ and 
ÒNotiÞcation ReportÓ commands to the device under Lifeline group.
!
When door sensor is opened:
!
Sensor Binary Report, Value = 0xFF, Type = 0x0A 
NotiÞcation Report, NotiÞcation Type = 0x06, Event = 0x17 
When door sensor is recovered:
 
Sensor Binary Report, Value = 0x00,Type = 0x0A 
NotiÞcation Report, NotiÞcation Type = 0x06, Event = 0x16 
When tamper switch is triggered or recovered, the door sensor will send ÒSensor Binary ReportÓ 
and ÒNotiÞcation ReportÓ command to the device under Lifeline group.
!
Tamper Triggered:
!
Sensor Binary Report, Value = 0xFF,Type = 0x08 
NotiÞcation Report, NotiÞcation Type = 0x07, Event = 0x03 
Tamper recover
 (press tamper switch for 0.5s):
!
Sensor Binary Report, Value = 0x00, Type = 0x08 
NotiÞcation Report, NotiÞcation Type = 0x07, Event = 0x00
Battery report
When the door sensor is wake-up it will check the battery status. If the battery status is low it 
will send the Battery Report to the gateway under Lifeline group every hour.
Battery Report, Battery Level = 0xFF 
Association Group2 
If there is any device under Association Group2, the door sensor will send ÒBASIC SETÓ 
command to control those devices when the door sensor is triggered. For example: when the door 
sensor is triggered, it sends adjustable parameter ÒBASIC SETÓ command to a lamp under

Group2, you can adjust the lampÕs luminance through the parameters of this command; if the set 
light-up time out (see the ConÞguration Description), the sensor will send ÒBASIC 
SETÓcommand to turn-off the lamp. 
When sensor is triggered:
!
[Command Class Basic
J_
Basic Set,Value = 0xFF(default 0xFF, conÞgurable, see the 
ConÞguration Description)] 
When light-up time out:
!
[Command Class Basic
J_
Basic Set,Value = 0x00] 
ConÞguration Description 
a) ÒBasic SetÓ conÞguration
!
If there is any device under Association Group2, the door sensor will send ÒBasic Set = valueÓ 
command to control that device when the door sensor is opened. ÒValueÓ conÞguration rule is as 
below:
 
b) Turn Off Light Time ConÞguration
!
If there is any device under Association Group2, the door sensor will send ÒBasic Set = valueÓ 
command to Group2, and send ÒBasic Set = 0x00Ó command to turn-off light after ÒtÓ seconds,
!
Set value = ÒtÓ, means to send Basic Set command after ÒtÓ seconds.
 
c) Door Sensor Status Report
The Door Sensor will automatically send the tamper status.
Set value = t, If ÒtÓ >0 means ÒtÓ hours if ÒtÓ= 0 NO status report active.

Guide  
Choosing the right sensor type

BeSense has  developed three kind of sensors  to  cover all the security 
and automation needs that all todayÕs living  requests. 
Sensors, which can automatically turn lights on when you enter a room
 and 
off when you leave, are a smart and easy way to save energy also they will 
let you know if someone is walking around where they shouldn
Õt.  
This is a quick guide that will help you to understand  the difference 
between each type of sensor  and which is the best option for your project. 
An important recommendation for any sensor you choose: 
Av o
id mounting sensors close to air vents, as the vibration and air 
flow can reduce the effectiveness of the sensor (PIR sensors should 
not be within 4 ft of an air vent
) 
IX30 BeSense Z-Wave, Wall PIR Motion 
Detector
 
P
et immune motion detectors 
disregard
 the 
motion 
caused by animals
 weighing less than 55 pounds. IX30 
uses
 passive infrared (PIR) motion detector technology to 
! 
Type of BeSense Sensors
"

ay @ ||


monitor heat changes in a designated area. 
With a traditional motion detector, when your pet enters the coverage area, 
a sensor is tripped and causes a false alarm. Pet immune motion detectors 
ignore the motion caused by animals and thus reduce the likelihood of a 
false alarm.
 
The IX30 Wall sensor works better  in a small and enclosed spaces with 
high levels of occupancy  movement because it has been developed to be 
more sensitive to the movement. PIR technology easily detects people 
walking in and out of a space. 
 
Ideal Uses: 
-
Small rooms 
-
Low ceilings (less than 7 feet)
 
-
Presence of animals like dogs or cats. 
-  High sensitive for people movements.
 
IX32 BeSense ZWave Ceiling Motion Detector
 
T
he 360¡ Ceiling-Mount Motion Sensor with Passive Infrared 
(PIR) technology  that does just that in all directions.
 
This type of sensor is ideal for spaces that have tall furniture 
along a wall.
 
Ideal Uses: 
-
Open Offices 
-
Recommended for 7Ð12ft (2Ð3.7m) ceilings 
 


-
Hallways with more than three entrances 
-
Conference rooms 

IM20 BeSense Door/Window Sensor 
 
Of all the security devices out there, contact sensors might seem 
the least interesting. They're small, simple and unobtrusive, with a 
single function: to detect the opening and closing of 
doors, 
windows, cabinets and drawers
.
 
From screen doors to cigar humidors, contact sensors can be 
applied virtually anywhere where you need to know about activity. 
 
Ideal Uses: 
-
Front and Back door 
-
Garage door 
-
Downstairs windows 
-
ChildrenÕs windows 
-
Closest and cabinets

Example 1 
 
In this example, we placed ceiling-mounted sensors along the walkway so the coverage 
pattern overlaps to avoid dead spots. We also placed the sensors away from air vents in 
order to avoid reliability issues. 
Example 2 
 
In this example, a wall-mounted sensor makes the most sense. The desk is close 
enough to the wall to be within the minor motion coverage area, and using a wall-
mounted sensor along the same wall as the door prevents the sensor from looking out 
into the space. Because the door opens into the space, the sensor can see someone 
entering regardless of the doorÕs position. In terms of the sensorÕs lateral position along 
 Sensor placement examples 
 


the wall, we want to keep it close to the desk, but away from any air vents that might be 
in the ceiling.
 
 
Example 3 
 
In this example weÕre using a ceiling-mounted occupancy sensor. This type of sensor is 
ideal for spaces that have tall furniture along a wall. 
 
When placing the sensor on the ceiling, we want to try to have the desk inside of the 
minor motion coverage area, but we also want to keep the sensor as close to the wall 
with the door as possible in order to minimize the sensorÕs view out the door. Any air 
vents in the space will also affect sensor placement.

House 
Living in a house or apartment,  the front and  back doors are two important spots to 
control at all times
. 
We have also installed a Wall Sensor  that  controls the storage room door, so we can 
keep control of tools and dangerous cleaning chemicals
 
In the kitchen and living area we chose ceiling sensors  to turn on the lights when 
someone comes in from the outside or from the bedrooms
 
The kitchen sensor should be placed over 8ft high.
