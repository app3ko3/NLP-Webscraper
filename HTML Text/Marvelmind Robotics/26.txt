Why Marvelmind
Robot does the job
Marvelmind Robot v100 does only one type of job, but does it very well. It reliably and predictably delivers its cargo from point A to point B (C, D, E and farther).
Cost-efficient
We really love when our customers enjoy our products. It is much easier to enjoy a robot that doesn't cost you a fortune.
Easy to use
When the robot is intuitively simple and logical, it's a pleasure to use. We strive for that feeling and are eager to share it with you in all of our products.
Worldwide presence
With our unique Precise (±2cm) Indoor "GPS" we have customers in 50+ countries. We are now happy to offer the Autonomous Delivery Robot v100 to them.
