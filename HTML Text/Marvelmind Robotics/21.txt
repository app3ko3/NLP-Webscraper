Indoor “GPS”
Radio signal from GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/Beidou satellites is too weak to penetrate through walls. Thus, we can’t have regular GPS indoor.
Therefore, one needs to build an Indoor “GPS” – a local indoor positioning system:
RTLS – real-time locating system
LPS – local positioning system
IPS – indoor positioning system
INS – indoor navigation system
Indoor “GPS”
Effectively, all acronyms above is the same thing, but with different names and slightly different meanings:
RTLS and LPS are not necessarily indoor. For example, GPS is also an RTLS. But, typically, by RTLS means non-global and non-satellite based systems
IPS provides positioning, but not necessarily navigation, i.e. it is good for tracking something or somebody
INS has to provide positioning in order to provide navigation. However, in practice INS and IPS are very often used interchangeably for defining all sorts of non-GNSS based systems
By the way, GNSS stands for Global Navigation. Satellite System. GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou are GNSS systems.
Key elements of any Indoor "GPS"
Mobile beacons, often called tags, placed on or attached to your mobile objects (vehicles, robots, drones, people)
Stationary beacons, often call anchors. These are your “GPS satellites” – points the mobile beacons calculate their position
“Ground station” – something that controls the system, collects the location data from beacons and communicates with external world
Types of Indoor "GPS"
There are many different types of Indoor “GPS” possible. See a detailed review and comparison below:
