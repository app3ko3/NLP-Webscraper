HOME PhoXi 3D Scanner
PhoXi 3D Scanner S

Useful especially for inspection & quality check-up. The scanning range is larger than in the case of the XS version. However, the general rule of thumb says it is best used for scanning of objects that fit into one’s hand. This is the first model that can be used also for bin picking of objects from small bins.
