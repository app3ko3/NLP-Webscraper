Parallel Structured Light brings the state-of-the-art quality and resolution of structured light scanning into the 3D reconstruction of highly dynamic scenes. This novel patented technology uses a clever sensor design which performs the acquisition in one snapshot as opposed to the sequential scanning of a standard image sensor. This means that the Parallel Structured light method practically freezes the 3D scene in time.

* considering general use case for vision guided robotics
High level of detail on unpredictable movement
Capture and reconstruct chaotic and unpredictable movements into highly accuracy point clouds for further processing.
High speed scenes recognition
The only 3D camera in the world that can produce high-accuracy point clouds of dynamic scenes.
Glossy, rough, or indifferent textiles
Reconstruct accurate point clouds of textured, matte, glossy or even deformed objects.
Organic materials and their textures
Produce high-quality images of a variety of food in motion. No need to worry about the color, shape or structure - always get the most accurate point cloud.
Large variety of packaging
Whether you want to recognize small boxes or large packages, there is a right model for you. Enjoy immediate results without motion blur.

Small up to large surfaces
Enjoy the high level of detail even on edges and thinner objects. Now you no longer have to worry about inaccuracies caused by vibrations or ambient light.
