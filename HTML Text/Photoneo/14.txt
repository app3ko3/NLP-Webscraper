HOME PhoXi 3D Scanner
PhoXi 3D Scanner XL

The only industrial scanner in its class with the highest scanning volume. It is especially useful when it comes to the scanning of large objects that are further away from the scanner itself whilst requiring high accuracy. A typical example is a depalletization.
