Autonomous driving/ HD map
  More safety, more reliability, and more scalability
Provides a critical element of autonomous driving; accurate location, supported by available GNSS data but still effective in GNSS denied environments.
Works in parallel with existing software with a “software fusion” approach to enable greater safety and reliability.
State-of-the-art relocalization using “GN-net” massively expands autonomous driving capability in tough situations (e.g. bad weather, summer vs winter season).
Brings more robustness to HD maps by integrating maps created by Kudan / Artisense SLAM.
Benefits of Kudan software
More accurate location and robustness from tightly-coupled Visual-Lidar SLAM.
Significantly lighter Lidar map (original raw data can be reduced by more than 300x).
Ultra-low-latency localization using IMU fusion (data rate can be greater than 1000Hz).
And many more features!
Example projects
localization software for autonomous vehicles, robo taxis.
Autonomous vehicle parking solution.
Kudan software and sensors packaged as a single SLAM sensor module.
Lidar calibration tool leveraging SLAM.
Integrate map layers created by KudanSLAM into existing HD map layers.
