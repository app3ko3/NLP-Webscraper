Structure SDK (iOS) Features
Never developed with a 3D sensor before? Structure SDK (iOS) includes high-level APIs that get you started quickly. Need 3D scanning and texturing? Volumetric reconstruction? Our APIs have you covered. Prefer to develop at a low level? You'll have direct access to the same raw data and low-level controls on Structure Sensor that we do.

Structure SDK (iOS)
Effortlessly Create iOS Apps with 3D Sensing
The Structure SDK (iOS) provides developers with a stable, easy-to-use, flexible and constantly-improving framework for creating iOS applications in Xcode which leverage advanced computer vision capabilities and techniques.
Just drop Structure.framework into your Xcode project, initialize the Structure Sensor in your code... and you're ready to develop with depth. It's really that easy.
Download Structure SDKs
Apps created with Structure SDK (iOS) can be launched on the App Store. The SDK contains source code for sample apps with 3D scanning, indoor mapping and more to get you started.
Initializing Structure Sensor in five lines of code:
STCaptureSession* captureSession = [STCaptureSession newCaptureSession];

captureSession.delegate = self;

[captureSession startMonitoringWithOptions:
  @{ kSTCaptureSessionOptionColorResolutionKey    : @(STCaptureSessionColorResolution640x480),
     kSTCaptureSessionOptionDepthSensorEnabledKey : @(YES), }];

Structure SDK (Cross-Platform)
Powerful 3D Perception Beyond the Tablet
Structure Core takes the industry-leading depth processing of Structure SDK (Cross-Platform) to a wider array of devices and platforms than ever before.
Prototype here, run there
Structure SDK (Cross-Platform) is optimized and natively compiled for great performance no matter if you’re using macOS, Windows, Linux (ARM and x64) or Android.
Everything is in sync
With the new Structure Core and Structure SDK (Cross-Platform), you can access perfectly-synced data from any combination of depth, visible, and IMU streams. No more need to write complex code to combine multiple sensors.
Initializing Structure Core for Android:
ST::CaptureSessionSettings settings;
settings.source = ST::CaptureSessionSourceId::StructureCore;
settings.structureCore.depthEnabled = true;
settings.structureCore.visibleEnabled = true;
settings.structureCore.infraredEnabled = true;
settings.structureCore.accelerometerEnabled = true;
settings.structureCore.gyroscopeEnabled = true;
settings.structureCore.depthResolution = ST::StructureCoreDepthResolution::SXGA;
settings.structureCore.imuUpdateRate = ST::StructureCoreIMUUpdateRate::AccelAndGyro_1000Hz;

session.startMonitoring(settings);
                    
Want to use the Structure Sensor with other platforms?
USB Hacker Cable
The USB Hacker Cable lets you plug original Structure Sensor into any USB 2.0 device, and will charge your sensor battery more quickly than a power adapter.
