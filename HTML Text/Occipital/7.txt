What’s LiDAR?
LiDAR is a sensor that measures points in 3D space by timing how long it takes for infrared light beams to bounce back to their source. It’s the same technology that powers self-driving cars, and it is now embedded into the latest generation of Pro iOS devices.
Canvas combines LiDAR data with its own computer vision technology to create accurate 3D scans and CAD files.
Learn more about LiDAR in Apple’s Keynote featuring Canvas.

Using Canvas saves my clients approximately $1,500 on measuring and modeling their home, and they get me out of their house in 15% of the time.
