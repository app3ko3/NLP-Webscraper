Hello,
The community forums has been a place for developers, hobbyists, customers and people excited to scan with Structure Sensor to meet since 2015. As our business has changed we have found that we can provide quicker, more complete answers via our support articles, and the direct contact us feature listed on each of our articles.
We are fully dedicating ourselves to continuing support via those methods, as such we are going retire new content creation on the Community Forums in 30 days (June 11th, 2021). The content, and posts on this site will remain available for a year as we transfer the most viewed, searched, and helpful content to our support articles.
Thank you to those that have contributed the the Community Forums in the past, we look forward to working with you closely via our support page.
Thank you,
The Occipital Team
