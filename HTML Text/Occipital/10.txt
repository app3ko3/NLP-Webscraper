NEW!Misty II is now available, featuring Structure Core
Depth, refined.
With Structure Core, we've rethought depth from the inside-out. The result is a pocket-sized all-in-one computer vision powerhouse, with onboard wide vision camera, stereo infrared, an onboard DSP, and even a color module.
Designed with precision
Now equipped with 3 cameras, onboard IMU and NU3000 processor, Structure Core is our most advanced depth sensor ever.
We built great spatial computing software so you won't have to.
Great hardware is nothing without exceptional software. Structure Core is paired with Structure SDK to enable products and projects with a world-class software foundation for stunning performance.
