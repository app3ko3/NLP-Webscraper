Our New Video is out
Posted on April 30, 2018
We have recently released a new video showing the capabilities of our latest Silicon Eye Rino 3 evaluation kit. It shows the performance of our new event-based vision sensor (“SEES 1”) which is based on a novel pixel architecture as well as the capabilities of our inside-out tracking pipeline (“EIVO”) for applications in the field of augmented and virtual reality.
Have a look and let us know what you think in the comment section:
