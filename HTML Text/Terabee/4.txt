ACCESSORIES
Small, lightweight and highly versatile, Terabee sensor modules can easily integrate into your sensing applications thanks to easy-to-use data streams and practical USB or I2C/UART interfaces.
LIDAR TOF RANGE FINDERS
Discover these Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensors which allow you to measure a single point and return distance values in millimeters at high speed. They are plug and play, eye-safe and easy to use as single sensors or combined in multi-sensor arrays. Typical applications include robotics and drone distance sensing, proximity sensing, level monitoring, object counting and more.
APPLICATIONS
Robotics navigation
Drone obstacle avoidance
Presence detection, object counting
Level monitoring
DISTANCE SENSOR MODULES
MULTI-DIRECTIONAL ARRAYS FOR COLLISION AVOIDANCE
