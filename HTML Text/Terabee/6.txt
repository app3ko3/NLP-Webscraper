SOLUTIONS FOR CONTACTLESS AND SAFE LEVEL MONITORING
How can you know how much material is left in your silos, without actually leaving your office? Do you want to reduce costly and sometimes dangerous physical inspections of silos and other storage units?

Install Terabee devices and obtain real-time level data of solid, powder or liquid materials, directly from your silos and tanks. By using LED Time-of-Flight (ToF) technology we can reach up to 60m range for safe, non-intrusive inventory management of even the largest silos!

Consult with our experienced team to find a suitable solution for your project.

Use case. Terabee partners with Brunata AG for IoT silo level monitoring in Switzerland
Val Jelinic, Head of Ecosystem and IoT Solutions, Brunata AG, explains: “Valuable to us was quickly getting live data from the device after the installation. This enabled us to immediately show the remaining feed level to the farm manager, who was participating in the installation. His response “Wow! I thought we had more feed left!?” perfectly summed up the exercise.”
