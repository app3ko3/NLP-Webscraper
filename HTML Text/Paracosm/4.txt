Airborne Laser Scanning
Airborne Laser Scanning
Airborne Laser Scanning is a rapid and highly accurate measurement method, used to measure the surface of the earth with the use of pulses of light and their reflections (produced by a laser light source). These pulses of light are emitted from the 3D laser scanner (Lidar) that is mounted on an airborne vehicle, like planes and helicopters. A major advantage of airborne laser scanning is the ability to provide data from both the terrain and features under a forest canopy. Producing digital terrain and surface models could be considered the main application of airborne laser scanning. Airborne laser scanning is mainly used in surveying en geodesy, archaeology, urban planning and environmental management and research like forestry, geology, geomorphology and seismology.
