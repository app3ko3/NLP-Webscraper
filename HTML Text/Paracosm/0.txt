About Paracosm
Paracosm develops portable lidar-capture and visualization technologies that anyone can use to document indoor and outdoor spaces in rich 3D. Its small SLAM-based lidar scanner, the PX-80, has become a favorite for professionals who use 3D capture in ways it has never been used before, as well as those looking to develop fast new workflows in forestry, facilities management, indoor and outdoor survey, and construction progress monitoring. Paracosm was founded in 2013 in Gainesville, FL and became part of Occipital, Inc. in 2017. To learn more, visit paracosm.io
