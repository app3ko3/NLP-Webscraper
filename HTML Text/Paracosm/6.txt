Terrestrial Laser Scanners
Terrestrial Laser Scanners
Terrestrial Laser Scanners are used for detailed 3-dimensional data acquisition of objects. Laser scanning is a very fast and cheap way to produce 3D Models. Terrestrial Laser Scanners have applications in many different areas such as deformation measurements, quality control or topographical surveying and cultural heritage monitoring. This broadly used survey instrument is also called static terrestrial laser sanners (STLS), 3D scanner, 3D laser scanner or Lidar scanner. The prefix 'terrestrial' indicates that it is a Lidar scanner for geospatial measurements. Buying a terrestrial laser scanner? Weigh in mind a price between $15,000 and $120,000, depending on its range, accuracy and other data acquisition capabilities.
