USVs - Unmanned Surface Vehicles
USVs - Unmanned Surface Vehicles
Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are vehicles that operate on the surface of the water without a crew. USVs have many applications similar to Small Survey Boats but have the advantages of being deployable without a crew. This makes Unmanned Surface Vehicles cheap and easy to use.
