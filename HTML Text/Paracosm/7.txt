What is a total station?
A Total Station is an electronic/optical instrument used for angle measurements, distance measurements and coordinate measurements. Total Stations can be controlled remotely and are mounted on surveying tripods. A Total Station uses a surveying prism as its measurement target, and the ability to remotely control or track those targets automatically eliminates the need for an assistant staff.
