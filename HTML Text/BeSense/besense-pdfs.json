IX30 \nuses\n passive infrared (PIR) motion detector technology to \n! \nType of BeSense Sensors\n\"\n\nay @ ||\n\n\nmonitor heat changes in a designated area. \nWith a traditional motion detector, when your pet enters the coverage area, \na sensor is tripped and causes a false alarm. Pet immune motion detectors \nignore the motion caused by animals and thus reduce the likelihood of a \nfalse alarm.\n \nThe IX30 Wall sensor works better  in a small and enclosed spaces with \nhigh levels of occupancy  movement because it has been developed to be \nmore sensitive to the movement. PIR technology easily detects people \nwalking in and out of a space. \n \nIdeal Uses: \n-\nSmall rooms \n-\nLow ceilings (less than 7 feet)\n \n-\nPresence of animals like dogs or cats. \n-  High sensitive for people movements.\n \nIX32 BeSense ZWave Ceiling Motion Detector\n \nT\nhe 360\u00a1 Ceiling-Mount Motion Sensor with Passive Infrared \n(PIR) technology  that does just that in all directions.\n \nThis type of sensor is ideal for spaces that have tall furniture \nalong a wall.\n \nIdeal Uses: \n-\nOpen Offices \n-\nRecommended for 7\u00d012ft (2\u00d03.7m) ceilings \n \n\n\n-\nHallways with more than three entrances \n-\nConference rooms \n\nIM20 BeSense Door/Window Sensor \n \nOf all the security devices out there, contact sensors might seem \nthe least interesting. They're small, simple and unobtrusive, with a \nsingle function: to detect the opening and closing of \ndoors, \nwindows, cabinets and drawers\n.\n \nFrom screen doors to cigar humidors, contact sensors can be \napplied virtually anywhere where you need to know about activity. \n \nIdeal Uses: \n-\nFront and Back door \n-\nGarage door \n-\nDownstairs windows \n-\nChildren\u00d5s windows \n-\nClosest and cabinets\n!\n\n\n \nOpen O\n!\nce \n \nExample 1 \n \nIn this example, we placed ceiling-mounted sensors along the walkway so the coverage \npattern overlaps to avoid dead spots. We also placed the sensors away from air vents in \norder to avoid reliability issues. \nExample 2 \n \nIn this example, a wall-mounted sensor makes the most sense. The desk is close \nenough to the wall to be within the minor motion coverage area, and using a wall-\nmounted sensor along the same wall as the door prevents the sensor from looking out \ninto the space. Because the door opens into the space, the sensor can see someone \nentering regardless of the door\u00d5s position. In terms of the sensor\u00d5s lateral position along \n Sensor placement examples \n \n\n\nthe wall, we want to keep it close to the desk, but away from any air vents that might be \nin the ceiling.\n \n \nExample 3 \n \nIn this example we\u00d5re using a ceiling-mounted occupancy sensor. This type of sensor is \nideal for spaces that have tall furniture along a wall. \n \nWhen placing the sensor on the ceiling, we want to try to have the desk inside of the \nminor motion coverage area, but we also want to keep the sensor as close to the wall \nwith the door as possible in order to minimize the sensor\u00d5s view out the door. Any air \nvents in the space will also affect sensor placement. \n \n\n\n\"\n\nZwave\nSwitch\n\nHouse \nLiving in a house or apartment,  the front and  back doors are two important spots to \ncontrol at all times\n. \nWe have also installed a Wall Sensor  that  controls the storage room door, so we can \nkeep control of tools and dangerous cleaning chemicals\n \nIn the kitchen and living area we chose ceiling sensors  to turn on the lights when \nsomeone comes in from the outside or from the bedrooms\n \nThe kitchen sensor should be placed over 8ft high.\n \n \n\n\n\n"}}
