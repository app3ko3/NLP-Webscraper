Multi-sensor system
A combination of single-layer and multi-layer LiDAR strategically positioned for a much broader range of capture compared to a single sensor system. 
Unrivalled 360° capture
Six cameras capture images in every direction without obstruction or blind spots. The result is the most comprehensive panorama capture capabilities on the market.
Expansive display
See exactly what is being scanned and assess the quality of the data with live feedback displayed on a 10 inch touchscreen display that is built into the device.
Unprecedented speed
Mobile scanning on wheels offers a fully scalable solution for large indoor environments. Fast capture with minimal disruption to the surroundings extends the use of 3D scanning to environments that don't allow for downtime.
Snaps into place
NavVis M6 requires no tools for on-site set up and dismantling, and can be transported in three mobile cases.
Compatible with ground control points
For survey-grade accuracy and automatic dataset alignment, NavVis M6 is compatible with ground control points.

Industry applications
Scan-to-BIM / CAD
Fast capture for scan-to-BIM workflows with the only mobile point cloud quality suitable for modeling. All-in-one reality capture enables virtual as-built verification using NavVis IVION.
CAD floorplans
Improve efficiency in CAD floorplan workflows. Our devices quickly capture detailed point clouds of large, complex environments that can be used for CAD drawing.
Digital twins
Extend existing projects by offering NavVis IVION as a new deliverable that makes building scans accessible to every stakeholder as a fully immersive, web-based digital twin.
Scalable scanning of commercial and industrial properties
A fast, fully scalable mobile mapping system on wheels that captures at the speed of walking through commercial and industrial environments where every second of downtime counts.
NavVis M6 made it possible for us to apply 3D scanning to manufacturing facilities where both minimal disruption and high-quality data are essential."
