In case you were wondering...
How to get started with the following 3 different solution sets:
Indoor Mapping / Location / Analytics
Not a lot! To get things going all you need to deliver is:
a map/CAD file of the store
a planogram
a product database
With that, we can do our magic. When we have finished that we’ll help you to implement the SDK in your app and/or mobile website and off you go!
AR Navigation / Experiences
Simply explain to us your goals and our team can create a scope of work to deliver the experience you want. And if we’re not best suited to help, we’ll refer you to one of our many industry partners.
  How we deal with privacy?
We do not collect any identifiable personal data from users. In fact, our users are completely anonymous to us. We never collect name, email address, phone number, social media ID, or anything else which can identify a user. We also do not collect any identifying information about the device (e.g. serial number, MAC address).
What about our changing store?
All covered! We fully understand how things work in retail. That’s why we built Store Builder. Store Builder allows retailers to scan and tag products with locations in-store with a mobile device (phone or tablet). Then data-link to a store map aisle sub-location. Just drag and drop and you’re ready!
Aisle411 creates an immersive experience for your guests
Deploying in over 14,000 Venues Across Retail, Office, Airports, Conferences and more, we are now ready to expand.  Aisle411 is ranked #2 Globally for Indoor location, Analytics and Advertising trailing only Google and tied with Apple with who we both partner.
“Aisle411 is uniquely positioned in the retail environment, combining a highly innovative approach to new technologies and services with a growing number of important clients. Amongst a sea of startups in this space in 2016, ABI Research ranks Aisle411 as having the best combination of capabilities to be a major success.”
