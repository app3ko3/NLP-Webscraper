TOPOSENS SECURES SERIES PRE-A FUNDING
Written by
Munich-based high-tech startup secures further investments for the market launch of the world’s first 3D Ultrasonic Collision Avoidance Sensor
  Munich, 28/03/2022. Toposens GmbH has successfully completed its Series Pre-A financing round, intended to support the scaling-up of its proprietary 3D ultrasonic echolocation sensing technology. The round is led by existing investors ALPANA Ventures from Switzerland, Basinghall Partners from the UK and joined by Belgium-based SPDG Ventures.
The funding for Toposens has thus increased to a total of around €3.9 million since 2018.
The investment is aimed at financing the market entry into the robotics market, enabling best-in-class 3D collision avoidance, helping Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) manufacturers build safer vehicles. Over the past year, Toposens made significant progress in onboarding well-known brands in the AGV space and piloting its collision avoidance sensing solution.
  Supporting Mass Market Deployment in Summer 2022

Additionally, the investment will support the mass market deployment and industrialization of the world’s first 3D Ultrasonic Echolocation Sensor “ECHO ONE” for 3D collision avoidance in industrial robotics and automotive projects; next to releasing the Toposens Processing Unit, which will be running the Toposens application software stack enabling a plug and play 3D collision avoidance solution for customers.
„This new investment helps us deploy 3D ultrasonic sensing to the market together with our lead customers.  Thereby we greatly improve the collision avoidance performance of their AGVs, which currently still suffer from high damage costs, due to undetected collisions other sensing systems fail to detect. After this initial rollout in 2022, we will raise our Series A to scale our products and ramp up the team to expand into additional market opportunities like Automotive. We are thankful for the continued trust in Toposens bringing this disruptive technology to the market” says Toposens CEO Tobias Bahnemann.
