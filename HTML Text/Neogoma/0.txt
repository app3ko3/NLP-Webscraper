WHO ARE WE
Neogoma has been created by foward-thinkers - always on the edge, even during team building activities! - who were initially trying to solve physical retail pain points using existing technologies, such as indoor positiong technologies (wifi, beacons) and QR code & bar codes for product information. Realizing AR could be the perfect interface but nobody was providing a solid visual positioning technology, we started to build products that could enable AR at world-scale, for retail and many more physical businesses.
