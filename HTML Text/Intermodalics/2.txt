WORLDWIDE
We serve customers around the globe
The Intermodalics Visual Positioning System - VPS - only needs a camera and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to do its magic. Using this sensors set, it will learn and map the environment and locate itself in it. When it revisits a mapped area, the technology will relocate your device instantly in that map.
Additional onboard sensors (GPS, odometry or laser), can enhance positioning using sensor fusion.
LOCALIZATION
Accurately track your position
Locate with respect to a reference map
SLAM
On the fly reference map creation
Overlay with a floor plan or annotate maps
manually or based on database information
Share maps across devices
Extend and update maps as the environment changes
Position tracking in a low-light environment.
Large scale visual map creation & updates (picture scale: supermarket size).
Product development support
Visual positioning or V-slam offers the flexibility to work with your specific application. We integrate novel localisation, navigation and slam algorithms with mobile robots, AGV/AMRs or any vehicle. 
VPS +SLAM, +SCAN, +NAV
Visual positioning allows your device to localize virtually anything in a map. Navigate a mobile robot, scan a room in 3D or augment your indoor sensors with position information!  We can offer you access to the rich data which vision systems provide.
OBSTACLE DETECTION, AVOIDANCE AND NAVIGATION
In combination with 3D cameras, this allows mobile robots to follow a path and detect and avoid obstacles.
FLOOR PLAN GENERATION AND
3D RECONSTRUCTION
Attaching a visual positioning system to a 3D camera allows for mapping rooms in 3D in an affordable way.
POSITION TRACKING FOR AUGMENTED REALITY AND VR
Augment mobile devices with position tracking such that they can offer immersive experiences.
