Position tracking in repetitive environments
Keeps working in changing environments such as expedition areas
Getting started
Starting with Visual Positioning needs only a few steps:
Map your warehouse by driving around one tracking unit
Store this visual map on your local map server
Align and annotate the visual map with a floorplan
Upload the visual maps to other tracking units
Show tracking data in a GUI and/or send it to your WMS
Applications
In most cases, a real-time localisation system is mounted on the vehicles which are driving around in warehouses or factories. You can use them stand-alone for analyzing heat-maps or spaghetti-diagrams, or integrate them with a Warehouse Management System for track-and-trace purposes. In the latter case, additional automated colli or pallet code scanning is required to link the trace code to the pick-up and drop-of location.
