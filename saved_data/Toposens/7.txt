Communication Interface
Detecting the Undetectable
The 3D Echolocation Sensor ECHO ONE® enables your mobile robot to reliably detect even the most complex objects in three-dimensional space, such as forklift forks, floor-based objects, and even glass. With a small blind zone, ultra-wide opening angle, and detection range of up to 3 m, you can reduce costly accidents whilst ensuring highest safety in any environment.
Based on our proprietary 3D ultrasonic technology, Toposens ultrasonic sensors use Time-of-Flight echolocation data for detection in three-dimensional space, filtered by the Toposens Processing Unit for 3D collision avoidance, offering you Next-Level Robotic Safety.

3D Collision Avoidance
Watch the below YouTube video to find out how the Toposens 3D Ultrasonic Echolocation Sensor ECHO ONE® and the Toposens Processing Unit are working together to provide your robot with next-level robotic safety.


1. Improve your overall operational efficiency
Is your AGV or similar robot not performing to the highest standards because the implemented sensor technology can only detect the nearest object?

2. Ease the hassle of set-up and integration
Are you tired of tedious integration procedures?

3. Reduce costly accidents by detecting even the most complex objects in 3D space
Is your AGV accident and deadlock prone because its existing sensor system struggles to detect transparent or complex objects such as forklift forks, or even small objects lying in the path of the AGV?

READ MORE
4. Use your AGV safely in any environment
Does your AGV perform in-efficiently in the external environment due to dirt, dust, bad weather - or bad lighting conditions?

READ MORE
5. Safe costs by using just one sensor with enhanced perception abilities
Do you find that you have to integrate several sensors to be able to cover a large enough detection area, adding to your surplus costs?

6. Improve AGV operational performance with a reduced blind zone
Does your mobile robot struggle to detect objects in ultra-close range within its immediate environment?
