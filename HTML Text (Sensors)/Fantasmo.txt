Unlocking the Future with Semantic 3D Maps
For Want of a Map
In a vacuum, positioning is useless no matter its precision. For instance a GPS coordinate such as `33°59'27.5"N 118°28'01.1"W` won’t do you any good unless you have a map which tells you that location is on Abbot Kinney Blvd in Venice, California.
With a map, there is all manner of useful information that can be obtained about a location:
What shops are nearby?
What is the shortest walking path to the beach?
Where are the good Instagram spots?
Positioning only becomes useful when it corresponds to a map. It then follows that the resolution of the map matters as much as the precision of the position.
Precision and Batteries Not Included
As it stands today, maps are sufficient for GPS, because GPS is not that precise. It varies by meters. In dense urban areas like Manhattan and San Francisco, GPS can be off by half a block! Even though maps provided by Google, Apple, OpenStreetMaps, and others are not sub-meter accurate, they are still good enough to serve GPS. For the automotive navigation use case, it works well in fact. Cars are large and have constrained motion, so they can be “snapped” to a road.
What happens though when the use case demands more? What happens when GPS is not enough?
A robot cannot be “snapped” to a road. It travels on sidewalks and needs to know where the location of curb-cuts and ramps — down to the centimeter. E-scooters have restricted speed zones along pedestrian paths. Persistent augmented reality content is not even possible.
This emerging class of spatial applications such as augmented reality, pedestrian navigation, robotics, and micromobility require sub-meter positioning. Such precision cannot be achieved through GPS or other infrastructure-based solutions. Fantasmo has created Camera Positioning System (CPS) for exactly this need.
Comparing Fantasmo’s CPS (Green) to GPS (Red) on a mobile device in downtown San Francisco. CPS vastly outperforms GPS which degrades harshly in the dense urban environment.
Precise Positioning Requires Precise Maps
A high resolution map is needed to take advantage of the hyper-accurate positioning enabled by CPS. Coincidentally, camera positioning requires the generation of a 3D map. Fantasmo’s map generation pipeline produces semantic 3D maps that are world-scale with centimeter-level precision.
A 3D map in Venice, California that includes all the semantic features spatial applications needs to operate.
The world is 3D, and our maps should reflect that. There is a wealth of semantic context that can be derived from 3D maps. It is possible to know the width of the road, the height of sidewalk curbs, the location of doorways, etc. All of this information can be embedded into the map to provide rich context for spatial applications.
By combining Fantasmo CPS and semantic 3D maps, applications unlock features that were never before possible. A demonstration is shown in the video below. A semantic 3D map was generated for Abbot Kinney Blvd that is label with street zones (i.e., sidewalk, parking spot, and road) and store fronts. Images taken with the mobile phone are used to determine the hyper-accurate position of the device. The position is precise enough to understand its semantic zone even when the zone is no wider than a meter.
A demonstration of the combination of Fantasmo CPS and semantic 3D maps.
Unlocking the Future
Spatial applications need both semantic 3D maps and hyper-accurate positioning to operate at the level we expect. Fantasmo provides a full end-to-end solution for 3D maps and positioning. This technology is not limited to outdoor use either. Our solution is well suited for indoor applications as well where alternative mapping and positioning solutions are even more restricted. In future posts, we will explore how maps push indoors.

The Technology That Will Save the Scooter Business
Mobility is the name of the game. People want to get places fast and easy. For last mile travel, there is nothing faster or easier than a scooter. Bird and Lime have shown how simple it was to “onboard” a city, seemingly overnight. Their success and the ease of entering the market has inspired a myriad of competitors/copycats. Dozens of companies are now rushing to litter every street corner with a white-labeled scooter to scrounge for their piece of the pie.
It’s unclear how many mobility solutions the market can bear, but it is crystal clear that cities are unwilling to find out. The deluge of scooters have plagued cities with as many problems as they are solving. Chief among these issues are inappropriate parking and riding in areas where motorized vehicles are restricted such as sidewalks and other pedestrian-only areas. Both of these issues pose a serious danger to pedestrians, other motorized vehicles, and city infrastructure.
Despite the issues, cities still want to find mobility solutions, because there are real benefits. Santa Monica Planning Director, David Martin, stated in August that the city seeks to “identify innovative solutions that help create a viable, well-operated long-term shared mobility program in Santa Monica.” They want to play ball on their terms and that means regulation. Cities, including Santa Monica, are now beginning to restrict which mobility companies can operate within their limits.
Cities are now a customer just as much as the riders.
And it is important that the scooter companies improve their valuable proposition to the cities. There are two ways to accomplish this. The first is to continue to provide the valuable transportation service to riders while preventing the riders from driving and parking illegally. The second is to provide valuable data that can be collected by scooters about the cities they operate in such as traffic and road conditions.
Both of these can be achieved by adding cameras to scooters, or more specifically, by using cameras to provide precise mapping and positioning. 2D images captured can be leveraged to build out semantic, 3D maps of cities and provide a hyper-accurate position of the scooter. So-called visual positioning is more precise than GPS and has centimeter level accuracy in dense urban environments — a notoriously bad environment for GPS. Visual positioning is accurate enough that a scooter can know when it is in prohibited zone even if the zone is only as wide as a sidewalk.
At Fantasmo we have been developing the Camera Positioning Standard (CPS) for precisely this type of application. GPS will not be enough to bring us into the age of the “Spatial Web” where augmented reality is everywhere, robots live and work alongside us, and scooters are an everyday part of our lives.
Comparison of Fantasmo’s CPS vs Traditional GPS
Our CPS solution provides the ability to find the position of a scooter accurately enough to know if a scooter is being ridden legally on the street or illegally on a sidewalk.
Riders and Chargers Can Find Their Scooters More Quickly in AR
This creates a better experience for everyone. Cities will have a wider variety of more sustainable mobility options. They will also have better intelligence about what is happening in the city. Riders and chargers will be able to find their scooters much faster. Scooter companies will have a better understanding of the location of their fleets, reduce losses, and, most importantly, provide the optimal scooter experience for riders, non-riders, and cities alike.
The quickest way for a scooter company to lose is to ignore these problems and not treat the city as a customer. Cities want to see more sustainable mobility solutions, but it must be done in a safe and responsible way.
If you’re interested in discussing CPS and how it could improve your application, please reach out.

Proposing an Open Camera Positioning Standard
Camera positioning is the next evolution of GPS. GPS was deemed too valuable to society to remain proprietary, and camera positioning should be no different. An open standard and framework is needed to facilitate cross-platform functionality and speed development towards universal mapping and localization for spatial applications.
Introduction
Camera positioning is the next evolution of GPS.
Camera-based techniques provide centimeter-level, 6 Degree-of-Freedom positioning that is well beyond the accuracy of other methods. From a single image, position and orientation can each be calculated along three axes. And unlike GPS, it works indoors and out. A multitude of current and emerging industries fundamentally require this capability:
• Augmented Reality
• Autonomous Robotics
• Indoor Navigation
• Accessibility
• Emergency Response
• Real World Search
• Checkout-Free Shopping
• Connected Home
• Smart Cities
• Autonomous Vehicles
The primary constraint of camera positioning is that it requires a machine-readable map of visually distinct features. Such maps can be built from a variety of input data types — 2D images, RGB-D images, and 3D point clouds — captured by image and depth sensors on mobile devices, IoT devices, robotics, and other platforms. These platforms share the same goal: build visual maps and calculate precise positioning from them.
An example of visual features detected in an image. These features are stored in a machine-readable format for camera positioning.
Why not share the maps?
In 2000, President Clinton issued a directive to make GPS unrestricted for public use. It was deemed a “global utility” that “benefits users around the world in many different applications” [1]. The next evolution should not be any different.
Interoperability between camera-equipped platforms improves coverage, update frequency, and development time. It facilitates a network effect of sensors. Mapping and positioning should not have to be the core competency of spatial application developers, but without interoperable maps, the technology and dataset will need to be built over and over again on every platform.
Google and many other companies are currently amassing their own proprietary datasets to use for visual positioning. The only companies that believe proprietary maps are a good solution are those that believe they can be the one to own them. While the walled garden may be convenient for developers to start, it allows single entities to dictate where and how the maps are used not to mention security and privacy considerations.
Camera Positioning Standard
An open standard is needed to facilitate cross-platform functionality and speed development towards universal mapping and localization for spatial applications. We are proud to propose the Camera Positioning Standard (C.P.S.) in advancement of this objective.
C.P.S. is infrastructure for spatial applications. The standard comprises a suite of machine-readable map data and messaging formats. It enables cross-platform exchange of heterogeneous, visual data that can be leveraged by existing and future localization techniques, including classification, regression, learning, and more. The full framework will include data format specifications and performant reference implementations compatible with common computer vision platforms.
Camera positioning allows for centimeter-level accuracy with 6 Degrees of Freedom and requires a machine-readable map.
Principles
Inspired by the principles of GRPC [2], C.P.S. should subscribe to the following:
Free and Open — Fundamental features must be free for all to use. Release all artifacts as open-source efforts with licensing that should facilitate and not impede adoption.
Interoperability — The framework must be platform agnostic so that it can be created and consumed by any camera-enabled platform.
General Purpose — The data formats should be applicable to a broad class of use-cases and localization approaches.
Performant — The data formats should be designed for efficient I/O, including support for parallel processing frameworks.
Unambiguous — Coordinate systems and reference frames should be consistent to ease interfacing with native applications and frameworks.
Coverage and Simplicity — The framework should be available on every common computer vision development platform and easily extensible to other platforms of choice. It should be viable on CPU and memory-limited devices.
Moving Forward
At Fantasmo, we are far along in development of a proposal for a feature-based map format along with an accompanying C++ reference implementation. The reference implementation will include an encoder and decoder with a concise API . We plan to release the reference implementation in July, with the specification draft following at the end of Q3.
Additional specifications and implementations will be developed with the community. Likely additional platforms include Python, iOS, Android, and ROS.
