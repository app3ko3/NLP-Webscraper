LOCATE, NAVIGATE, TRACK
Using a small camera, we give you position and orientation information of your assets.
What is Visual Positioning ?
The camera of a tracking unit. Each tracking unit consists of a camera connected to a small onboard computer.
Visual positioning is finding out your position and orientation by means of a camera. It’s usually used in large areas such as warehouses, production halls, supermarkets, airports or large public spaces :
You mount a tracking unit on your asset you want to track.
The camera learns your environment on the fly and builds a map.
It will offer you the position and orientation of the tracked asset in your map.
There is no need for markers, beacons or extra installations.

The Intermodalics Visual Positioning System - VPS - only needs a camera and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to do its magic. Using this sensors set, it will learn and map the environment and locate itself in it. When it revisits a mapped area, the technology will relocate your device instantly in that map.
Additional onboard sensors (GPS, odometry or laser), can enhance positioning using sensor fusion.

Our offer
We provide tracking units that each have a camera with a small computer included.
You mount a tracking unit on each forklift
The camera learns your warehouse on the fly
It will tell your WMS/ERP/YMS where each truck, colli or pallet is moving to.
Our solution has the same hardware installation cost for 5.000m2 or 100.000m2 
Position tracking in repetitive environments
Keeps working in changing environments such as expedition areas
Getting started
Starting with Visual Positioning needs only a few steps:
Map your warehouse by driving around one tracking unit
Store this visual map on your local map server
Align and annotate the visual map with a floorplan
Upload the visual maps to other tracking units
Show tracking data in a GUI and/or send it to your WMS
Applications
In most cases, a real-time localisation system is mounted on the vehicles which are driving around in warehouses or factories. You can use them stand-alone for analyzing heat-maps or spaghetti-diagrams, or integrate them with a Warehouse Management System for track-and-trace purposes. In the latter case, additional automated colli or pallet code scanning is required to link the trace code to the pick-up and drop-of location.

Since 2010, Intermodalics is developing software capabilities for autonomous and intelligent systems. Our customers are high-tech companies, start-ups and research institutes world-wide.
 ROBOTICS
Today, most robots are not aware of what’s happening around them. They can’t see who or what’s nearby and fail to detect or respond to changes in the environment. We add awareness and decision-making capabilities which enable robots to operate more autonomously.
DIGITAL INTELLIGENCE
Our customers are looking for ways to give meaning to their data. With sensors becoming ubiquitous, and providing a continuous stream of data, they need systems that can process and take actions on that data.  We create intelligent software that gives us meaningful data:  find out where things and people are, and support them in getting better together.
VISUAL POSITIONING SOLUTIONS
Using a small camera, our VPS software learns your environment and knows its position and orientation in that environment. We augment existing infrastructure and assets with position information and integrate it with the internet-of-things.
MARKETS AND APPLICATIONS - SOME EXAMPLES OF OUR WORK
AUGMENTED REALITY
We supported the Project Tango team to track the 3D motion of a mobile device using it's own camera's (VIO). Applications are 3D modeling, indoor navigation and augmented reality.
ROBOTIC SHELF INSPECTION AND PICKING
We assist our customers in scanning, taking inventory and picking from shelves in warehouses and shops.
SAFE POWERED PYLON INSPECTIONS
Together with our research partners,  KU Leuven and UGent, we performed drone missions to safely inspect the insulation of powered electricity pylons of Belgium's grid operator Elia.
SUPPORTING SPACE MISSIONS
For over five years, we support the USA space agency NASA at Goddard Space Flight Centre, Greenbelt, Maryland. Intermodalics supports the NASA Robotics Demonstration and Test team of Goddard Satellite Servicing Projects Division on-site and off-site with designing and upgrading their robotic technology software.
DEEP LEARNING
Deep Learning offers the most scalable and reliable solution to date for object detection and classification in images. Our team is highly qualified for dataset generation, designing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and network training.
INDOOR LOCALISATION AND STOCK COUNTING
We developed for logistics service provider H.Essers a vision based indoor positioning system and stock counting solution to enable automated guided vehicles (AGV) to autonomously localise pallets in a warehouse and to compare the information with the stock in a warehouse management system (WMS). 
TANGO ROS STREAMER
We created an Android App which streams Tango VIO and 3D scanning data to ROS ! The app and code are freely available for download in the Play Store and Github. More information can be found on the ROS wiki page.

We would like to share some employee testimonials with you because we value our employee’s happiness. 
And yes, we are proud when we receive positive feedback from their side! 
Johannes, who did his internship in the team in 2018, wrote the following in his report:
”During these eight months, I learned a lot about multiple computer vision concepts, but also about the general working  of a private company and the working in a software developer team. I realize that I was given a lot of opportunities, responsibility and trust. Having access to the full code base and being allowed to work in it, is something I don't expect  to  be possible in most companies. The guidance of my supervisors and other members of the developer team, was great.  They were involved, knew what I was doing, helped in case of problems, brought ideas and steered me to the right direction if needed, while still giving me a lot of  freedom and responsibility. I could not wish for a better internship environment.”
  “At the company, we're part of an amazing team working on fascinating projects that push the limit of what's possible in robotics. We have a unique environment for professional and personal growth, and we take great care in making this the best possible place to work in.”
Adolfo - Senior Roboticist
"My position is a mix of technical and commercial responsibilities which makes my job interesting and challenging. I love the variety and opportunities and I get to learn while doing.”
Rob - Application Support engineer
"Working at Intermodalics allowed me to improve my skills, while enjoying a friendly and respectful environment."
Ana Rita - Application support engineer
“As a world traveler Intermodalics gives me the opportunity to work remotely, even from the other side of the globe. Where else can you say working feels like vacation?”
Achim - Roboticist
