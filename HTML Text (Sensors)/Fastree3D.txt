PRODUCT
Our product is a flash LiDAR camera module that generates a high confidence point cloud. The output includes the (x, y, z) coordinates of the distance measured at each pixel, tagged with a quality of result (QoR) that provides an assessment of the reliability of the measurement. In addition, it can provide speed, intensity, and motion calculated for each pixel.
The camera module includes the illumination sources, the drivers, and a System on a Chip (SoC) in standard CMOS technology . The SoC includes the array of single-photon sensitive detectors/sensors (>10’000px), the ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) to pre-process the image information rendering it immediately actionable.
Our first release will be a Hardware Development Kit (HDK), designed to facilitate the development of applications. It will be used by partners to tailor the system performance to their specific applications.
Contact us to find out more about the HDK
ADVANTAGES
Our vision system benefits you by:
ELIMINATING FALSE DETECTION. Reduce false negative and false positive detections. Our sensors provide direct reliability quantification of each distance measurement you performed.
MINIMIZE LATENCY. A high frame-rate is not enough. Analysis of raw-data from multiple frames requires pipeline processing, resulting in high latency which introduces a “blind time” of several hundreds of ms (up tens of meters at automotive driving speed). To minimize the detection-reaction time, our sensors implement edge processing, bringing the computation into the detector itself using a System-on-Chip (SoC) approach.
INTELLIGENCE. The camera has different operating modes (distance, speed, motion, or intensity), or execute filtering based on threshold or alarm limits. Additional edge computing can be performed to improve sensor fusion.
AFFORDABLE TECHNOLOGY. The simplest design (flash, no scanning), in standard CMOS technology to leverage the economy of scale of consumer electronics.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Fastree3D imagers are flash LiDARs (Light Detection And Ranging) based on direct time of flight technology. The distance to objects is determined by measuring the time taken for a light pulse to travel from the imager to the object and back again. The on-board illumination module generates light pulses that illuminate the entire scene at once, like in conventional photography, without the need for any scanning/rotational optics. Our proprietary, CMOS-based sensor detects the reflected pulses and determines their time of arrival, thereby allowing the Digital Signal Processor, embedded in the System on Chip (SoC), to measure the Time-of-Flight (ToF) and consequently the distance. It’s that simple!
Low latencies, high reliability and robustness define our imagers. These attributes are the consequences of our technological approaches. Our measurement technique (based on Time-Correlated Single-Photon Counting) enables the evaluation of a per pixel quality measurement, in real time. The single-photon sensitive detectors (SPADs) mark the digital nature of the sensor. In other words, simple, digital, fast.
THE KEY FEATURES
FAST ACQUISITION SPEED. To provide awareness we need to have a representative data sample of the situation.
RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT. Each distance measurement performed by each pixel is provided with a quality of result. It is essential to trust in the data, they are driving the decision.
FLEXIBLE OUTPUT. The camera offers multiple operating modes (distance, intensity, speed, motion). Choose on the fly the one that better helps to complete a task. These features derive from the technology choices and hardware implementations we chose.

IMPROVEMENT FROM THE PAST
Conventional vision systems were developed around human needs (e.g. color sensitivity, resolution) and not those of automation. Even high-end sensors provide at most a distance measurement, and lack critical information required to avoid collisions. Machine vision can be improved with a high-confidence measurement of speed, direction and distance at low latency.
THE SOLUTION : Our sensors meet the three requirements for motion detection:
SPATIAL AWARENESS: rapidly monitors distances and motion around the camera.
TRUSTED INFORMATION: reliable measurements, even in adverse situations and with a confidence level assessment.
INTELLIGENCE: adaptive system capable of selecting the best operating mode for a given condition.

10 job opportunities!
Values
We are hiring exceptional talent to invent and deliver outstanding innovation. Candidates will have to bring the technical skills listed below but also embrace our values. We have tried to capture them in a few words below:
INVENTERS YET SIMPLIFIERS
This means designing for ultimately large scale adoption. It commands flexibility, creativity, the ability to move quickly from R&D to use-case and back and conceptual and practical thinking.
TEAM PLAYERS
We hire exceptional talent but we all also learn through mistakes and challenges, so we have placed a premium on men and women who support one another with an open mind to achieve individual results and monitor team progress.
DEDICATED & TENACIOUS
For the greater good, we never lose sight of the impact our invention will have on the near future, including our own. We never raise issues without offering solutions. We seek all options to move forward.
COMMITTED TO QUALITY
To the success of our partners, to our jobs. For us, this is a matter of personal satisfaction.
ENTREPRENEURIAL
We work with partners who aim to reinvent entire industries and do not settle for the status quo both on professional and personal levels. We acknowledge that it combines high risk with exponential reward potential over time

Values
We are hiring exceptional talent to invent and deliver outstanding innovation. Candidates will have to bring the technical skills listed below but also embrace our values. We have tried to capture them in a few words below:
INVENTERS YET SIMPLIFIERS
This means designing for ultimately large scale adoption. It commands flexibility, creativity, the ability to move quickly from R&D to use-case and back and conceptual and practical thinking.
TEAM PLAYERS
We hire exceptional talent but we all also learn through mistakes and challenges, so we have placed a premium on men and women who support one another with an open mind to achieve individual results and monitor team progress.
DEDICATED & TENACIOUS
For the greater good, we never lose sight of the impact our invention will have on the near future, including our own. We never raise issues without offering solutions. We seek all options to move forward.
COMMITTED TO QUALITY
To the success of our partners, to our jobs. For us, this is a matter of personal satisfaction.
ENTREPRENEURIAL
We work with partners who aim to reinvent entire industries and do not settle for the status quo both on professional and personal levels. We acknowledge that it combines high risk with exponential reward potential over time
